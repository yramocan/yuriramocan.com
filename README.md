# Yuri Ramocan Personal Portfolio Site

This is my personal portfolio site, built with Ruby on Rails. As you may be able to tell, I really like Ruby on Rails. This is a very simple application with only a couple models and controllers, all of which get served to the `index` action under the projects controller.

## Quick Start

To begin, first [download the source files.](https://github.com/yramocan/yuriramocan.com/archive/master.zip)

Then...
* `cd` to the project directory.
* Run `bundle` to ensure all gems are installed.
* Run `rails server PORT=3000` or `rails s PORT=3000` to start up server.
* Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your web browser.
